            My name is <b>Abimbola Comfort Jolayemi</b>.
        </p >
        <p class="intro">My first introduction to <i>programming language</i> 
            started in my second year in the University(Adekunle Ajasin University,to be precised),
            where I learned <i>FORmula TRANslation</i> (FORTRAN).I learned it for a period of about
            six months,with lots of challenging assignments and practice exercises to be submitted 
            before stipulated deadlines. During these period,I was challenged with lack of a Personal 
            Computer. But along the line, I felt uneasy as I saw the need to get one for myself, due 
            to the fact that I had a growing passion for technology. After a successful purchase, I 
            decided to expose myself to concept of <i>FrontEnd Development</i> in order to apply my 
            knowledge in creating websites using <b>HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT</b>. I am now so proficient
            in HTML,while still learning CSS, with a vision of mastering JAVASCRIPT soon, at
             <b>STUTERN'S GRADUATE ACCELERATOR</b>.

        <p class="learnt">So far,I have been able to learn about writing different Git commands. I also learnt how to create
             a remote repository
             on Github,how to commit and push codes unto Github.
            In addition to this, I learnt how to create an HTML file and how to insert the HTML skeleton.
            I also learnt how to use different HTML codes to determine the structure of a wabsite,
             using the appropriate tags,elements,headers,etc. Now,I'm learning how to style an HTML code using CSS.
             I now know how CSS is important in making websites pleasing to the eyes and making it much more easier to
              navigate.
